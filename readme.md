#Python Hangman :snake:

This is a simple hangman game written in Python. I have only just recently learned Python so this is my very first published application. I hope to find a way to integrate an online dictionary to get more random words.

UPDATE:

The game now retrieves a list of randomized words from [TheFreeDictionary](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dictionary.htm)

###package installation
